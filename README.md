This repository contains efficient implementations of fundamental data structures in C and C++, designed to build a strong foundation in memory management, algorithmic correctness, and performance optimization.
Features :
  Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists with insertion, deletion, and traversal operations
  
  Stacks & Queues: Array-based and dynamic implementations with push, pop, and enqueue/dequeue mechanisms
  
  Binary Trees: Basic binary tree operations, including traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
  
  Graph Algorithms: Implemented adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations with key algorithms such as:
    
  a) Breadth-First Search (BFS) & Depth-First Search (DFS)
  
  b) Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest paths
  
  c) Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s & Kruskal’s Algorithms)
